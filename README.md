# Arty - The React/Typescript Stack

## What is Arty?

Arty is a seed project, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). But more than that, it is a collection of extensions and patterns that work really well with React and Typescript. Arty consists of 2 repos: Arty Stack and Arty Docs. The [stack](https://github.rackspace.com/CARE/arty-stack) is the small seed project that includes React configured for Typescript. The [docs](https://github.rackspace.com/CARE/arty-docs) is the collection of GF markdown docs that describe common pattern, style guides, and extension instructions for using the stack...a sort of recipe book for creating apps with the seed project.

## Why is Arty?

This project was created with the hope to save other teams at Rackspace from having to research and rediscover designs, techniques, and patterns to implement in their software projects.

## Dependencies

Arty requires Node v8.7 or above.

## Creating a new project based on Arty

Clone the [arty-stack](https://github.rackspace.com/CARE/arty-stack) repo with Git and either run either `npm install` or `yarn install`, depending on your preferred Node package manager.

## Running Arty

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing

Run `yarn test` or `npm test` to run unit tests.

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Building

Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to create a set of bundled production files for your app.

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
